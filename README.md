# Hair-and-Skin-Segmentation
Machine Learning Project for Hair and Skin Segmentation using deep autoencoder
* Developed deep autoencoder using U-NET model for hair and skin segmentation using Keras
* ested the U-NET model on Celeb-A dataset
* Practised data augmentation and transfer learning on the built model
* Used libraries such as keras, numpy, sklearn
